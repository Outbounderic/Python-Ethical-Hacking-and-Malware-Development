# MAC Address Changer

## MAC (Media Access Control)
### What is it?
A MAC address is a permanant, physical, and unique address assigned to Network Interfaces (Wireless/Wired) by the device manufacturer. This address will remain the same for this device regardless of where it is installed.

The MAC address is used to identify a device within a network, whereas an IP Address identifies a device on the Internet. Every byte of data has a Source MAC and a Destination MAC to allow communication and transfer of data.

### Why change it?
The MAC Adress is used to identify a device on a network and by changing it the device is more anonymous. Filters are on networks to prevent certain devices from behaving in different ways, by changing a MAC Address to another devices it may allow you to Impersonate the other device, receiving data and priveleges associated with that device. It allows you to Bypass the Network Filters and connect to networks typically not allowed to Filtered Devices.

### How to change it?
1. Using the ifconfig command will list all of the network interfaces on a device and associated information such as IP Adresses, Netmasks, Broadcast, and MAC Address.
`ifconfig`
2. Using ifconfig select the network interface you want to change, select eth0 and include the down flag. This disables current network interface.
`ifconfig eth0 down`
3. Select the interface you want to modify, eth0, and add the hw (Hardwire) flag and select the class ether (Ethernet), create an address to replace the old one.
`ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55`
4. Enable the interface with the up flag.
`ifconfig eth0 up`
5. Run the ifconfig command once more and verify now that the changes to the eth0 interface have been successful.
`ifconfig`
